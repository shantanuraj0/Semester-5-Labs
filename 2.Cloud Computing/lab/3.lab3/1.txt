data structures you use to store network connection like social network- Graph

21 output

F4(n),f1(n),f3(n),f2(n)

data structures you use to store network connection like social network- Graph

finalize() is called by the garbage collector on ---> object is unreachable

Dynamic pr8

How do you display border 
Right 20 px
Left 15px
Bottom 5px
Top 1px
----------> 1px 20px 5px 15px

Run() and join()

Best algo for finding peak element -> divide and conq
Class thread methods in java---> D 

Class threads method in java ---. D

Binomial Coefficient 

Prefix expression--> 34

A list of n strings each of length n:- O(n^2logn)

prefix expression +,-,*,8,4,/,6,2,5:- 34

n-ary tree 14 internal nodes 29 leaf nodes:- 3

new element inserted in red black tree:- red, if node is not a root node

output: classSum{, void calc, int change:- 15 15

which methods are present in class thread:- run(),wait(),exit()

If one uses straight two way merge sort algo:- Option A

Five elements 2,4,6,8,10 are inserted into a queue --> 2,4,6

In a modified merge sort, the input array is splitted at a position one-third of the length(N) of the array -> T(N) = 3T(N/3) + N 

n1==n2 Num1==num2

You are given a figure starting at vertex M...  --> (M,S), then (M,N) then (N,O)


DEQUE question ...> 2,9

public class MyRunnable implements Runnable 
{ -> new Thread(new MyRunnable()).start()

Catalan numbers -> Binomial coef



  Keep on adding here.......
